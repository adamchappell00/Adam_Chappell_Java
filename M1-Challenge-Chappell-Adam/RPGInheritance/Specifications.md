###Create your solution in an IntelliJ project called RPGInheritance.

###Create the following three classes, each deriving from a common base class:

###Farmer

####Properties:
    name
    strength (initial value = 75)
    health (initial value = 100)
    stamina (initial value = 75)
    speed (initial value = 10)
    attackPower (initial value = 1)
    running (initial value = false)
    arrested (initial value = false)
    plowing (initial value = false)
    harvesting (initial value = false)

####Abilities:
    attack another character

###Constable

####Properties
    name
    strength (initial value = 60)
    health (initial value = 100)
    stamina (initial value = 60)
    speed (initial value = 20)
    attackPower (initial value = 5)
    running (initial value = false)
    arrested (initial value = false)
    jurisdiction

###Abilities:
    arrest another character
    attack another character


###Warrior
####Properties

    name
    strength (initial value = 75)
    health (initial value = 100)
    stamina (initial value = 100)
    speed (initial value = 50)
    attackPower (initial value = 10)
    shieldStrength (initial value = 100)
    running (initial value = false)
    arrested (initial value = false)

####Abilities:

    attack another character

###Using JUnit, implement test cases to verify the functionality of the three classes.
